2. **RouletteTable** - Interactive betting table with all bet types
3. **GameControls** - Spin, auto-play, bet management
4. **Statistics** - Comprehensive real-time statistics display

#### Responsive Design

```

### Key Technical Decisions

#### 1. Random Number Generation
Used `crypto.getRandomValues()` for cryptographically secure random numbers instead of `Math.random()` to ensure fairness.

#### 2. State Management
Used React hooks and local state instead of Redux/Context API for simplicity. The `useGameEngine` custom hook encapsulates all game logic.

#### 3. Statistics Calculation
Statistics are calculated on-demand from the complete spin history rather than incrementally updated. This ensures accuracy and allows for easy recalculation.

#### 4. Bet Representation
Each bet is a separate object with its own ID, allowing for multiple bets of the same type and easy tracking.

#### 5. Animation Timing
Spin animation is fixed at 2 seconds to provide consistent UX. This can be made configurable in future updates.

## Pending Features (Future Phases)

### Phase 4: UI/UX Enhancement
- [ ] Professional casino-style table design
- [ ] Smooth chip placement animations
- [ ] Sound effects (wheel spinning, chip placement, wins)
- [ ] Improved mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Visual charts for statistics
- [ ] Strategy configuration UI panel
- [ ] Session management UI

### Phase 5: Data Management
- [ ] Supabase integration
- [ ] Database schema implementation
- [ ] Session persistence
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Session history
- [ ] Export functionality (CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Import saved sessions

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
- [ ] Inside bets (Split, Street, Corner, Line)
- [ ] American Roulette option (00)
- [ ] Multiple strategies (Fibonacci, D'Alembert, etc.)
- [ ] Custom strategy builder
- [ ] Real-time charts and graphs
- [ ] Session comparison
- [ ] Strategy backtesting
- [ ] Performance analytics

## Known Limitations

1. **Inside Bets**: Only straight bets (single numbers) are fully implemented. Split, street, corner, and line bets have the logic but no UI.

2. **Strategy UI**: The Modified Martingale strategy is implemented but not configurable through the UI yet.

3. **Session Persistence**: No database integration yet - all data is lost on page refresh.

4. **Mobile UX**: Basic mobile support is present but the experience could be optimized further.

5. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support not yet implemented.

6. **Performance**: With thousands of spins, the history array can grow large. Pagination or lazy loading needed.

## Code Quality

### TypeScript Coverage
- [x] 100% TypeScript (no JavaScript files)
- [x] Strict mode enabled
- [x] All types properly defined
- [x] No `any` types used

### Best Practices
- [x] Functional components with hooks
- [x] Custom hooks for reusable logic
- [x] Proper separation of concerns
- [x] Constants extracted to configuration files
- [x] Comments for complex logic
- [x] Build passes with no errors

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests (not yet implemented)
- [ ] Integration tests (not yet implemented)
- [ ] E2E tests (not yet implemented)

## Performance Metrics

### Build Results
```
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /                                    7.78 kB          95 kB
└ ○ /_not-found                          875 B          88.1 kB

## Conclusion

The project has successfully completed **Phase 1 and Phase 2** of the implementation plan, with partial completion of **Phase 3**. The core game engine, betting system, and statistics are fully functional. The Modified Martingale strategy is implemented but needs UI integration.

The application is ready for testing and can be used to simulate roulette games and analyze betting strategies. The codebase is well-structured for future enhancements and follows modern web development best practices.

**Estimated Progress**: ~40% of total project (Phases 1-2 complete, Phase 3 partial)

**Time to Complete Remaining Phases**:
- Phase 3 (complete): 1 week
- Phase 4: 2 weeks
- Phase 5: 2 weeks
- Phase 6: 2 weeks
- **Total**: 7-8 weeks for full completion
