# Roulette Simulator - Codebase Exploration Summary

**Exploration Date**: October 23, 2025
**Thoroughness Level**: Very Thorough
**Status**: Complete

## Overview

I have successfully completed a comprehensive exploration of the /Original.NET/ directory containing the ASP.NET MVC5 Roulette Strategy Simulator application. This document provides a high-level summary of findings.

## What Was Found

### Project Type
- **ASP.NET MVC5 Web Application**
- Developed by Yury Primakov (March 11, 2017)
- Built on .NET Framework 4.5.2
- Uses AngularJS for frontend game logic

### Total Codebase Size
- **4 main JavaScript game logic files** (1,278 total lines)
- **1 main HTML/RAZOR view** (438 lines)
- **1 minimal C# backend** (30 lines MVC)
- **Configuration files** (C#, XML)
- **Frontend libraries** (jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS, Metronic theme)

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Game Architecture
The application follows a **frontend-heavy design pattern**:
- **Backend**: Minimal ASP.NET MVC (just serves static content)
- **Frontend**: Pure JavaScript/AngularJS handles all game logic
- **Client-side**: 100% of betting, statistics, and strategy logic

### 2. Core Files Identified

**Critical Game Logic (4 files)**:
1. **GameEngineController.js** - 506 lines
   - Modified Martingale strategy implementation
   - Bet placement and automatic doubling logic
   - Comprehensive statistics tracking
   - Game loop management

2. **RouletteTable.js** - 495 lines
   - 46 bet type definitions (37 inside, 10 outside)
   - Payout ratios and winning number mappings
   - Bet state management

3. **RouletteWheel.js** - 225 lines
   - 38-position wheel simulation
   - Random number generation

4. **global.js** - 53 lines
   - Message/notification utilities

**UI (1 file)**:
- **Index.cshtml** - 438 lines
  - Interactive roulette table
  - Betting controls and statistics panels
  - Event log and spin history

### 3. Strategy Implementation Details

**Modified Martingale Strategy**:
- Uses **only outside even-money bets** (Red/Black, Odd/Even, Low/High)
- Automatically detects consecutive patterns (e.g., 2+ reds)
- Places initial $10 bet on opposite pattern
- **Doubles losing bets** until win or loss limit reached
- **Loss limit**: 7 consecutive losses
- **Bankroll requirement**: $1,280 (covers up to 6 losses = $1,270)

**Key Algorithm**:
```
1. Detect pattern: 2+ consecutive results of same type
2. Place initial $10 bet on opposite
3. If loss: Double bet ($20, $40, $80, etc.)
4. If win: Reset to $10 and look for new pattern
5. Stop if: Win occurs, loss limit (7) reached, or insufficient funds
```

### 4. Betting System

**46 Total Bet Types**:
- **36 inside bets**: Individual numbers (0, 1-36, 00) - 35:1 payout
- **10 outside groups**:
  - Red/Black (1:1)
  - Odd/Even (1:1)
  - Low (1-18) / High (19-36) (1:1)
  - Dozens (2:1)
  - Columns (2:1)

**Active Betting** (in strategy):
- Only uses outside 50/50 bets (Red, Black, Odd, Even, Low, High)
- Never uses inside single numbers or combination bets

### 5. Statistics & Analytics

**Tracked Metrics**:
- Percentages: Red, Black, Green (zeros), Odd, Even, Low, High
- Trailing consecutive counts for each category
- Frequency distribution analysis
- Consecutive loss tracking with statistical analysis
- Observed vs theoretical probability comparison

**Key Calculation**:
- Theoretical: `(1 / 2^streakLength) * 100`
- Observed: `(frequency / totalBets) * 100`

### 6. Data Structures

**History Entry**:
- Spin number, result (color, number, odd/even), placed bets with outcomes

**Trailing History**:
- Streak length, type, spin count, bet count

**Unique Frequency Maps**:
- How many times each streak length occurred (2x, 3x, 5x, etc.)

### 7. Important Constants

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Starting Bankroll | $1,280 | Minimum for 6-loss streak |
| Initial Bet | $10 | First bet amount |
| Doubling Formula | 2x | Each loss doubles bet |
| Pattern Threshold | 2 | Consecutive spins to trigger |
| Loss Limit | 7 | Max losses before stopping |
| Min Trail | 5 | Record streak if >= 5 |
| Spin Interval | 3 seconds | Time between spins |

### 8. Code Quality Notes

**Strengths**:
- Clear separation of concerns (wheel, table, engine)
- Comprehensive statistics tracking
- Well-commented strategy explanation
- Interactive and responsive UI

**Issues**:
- Debugger statement at line 101-102 (needs removal)
- HTML strings built via concatenation (maintenance nightmare - noted by author)
- Global objects not fully namespaced
- Mixed jQuery and vanilla JavaScript styles
- Event log builds HTML dynamically (security consideration)
