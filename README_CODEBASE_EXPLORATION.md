   - Complete project structure breakdown
   - Core components and responsibilities
   - Modified Martingale strategy implementation details
   - Betting system architecture with all 46 bet types
   - Statistics and analytics system
   - Game loop flow documentation

3. **FILE_LOCATIONS_REFERENCE.md** (Navigation Guide)
   - Absolute file paths for all critical files
   - Line number references for key functions
   - Directory tree with marked key files
   - Quick lookup for finding specific code

## What Was Explored

A complete **ASP.NET MVC5 Web Application** (2017) implementing the Modified Martingale betting strategy for roulette simulation:

- **4 core JavaScript game logic files** (1,278 lines total)
- **1 main RAZOR/HTML view** (438 lines)
- **1 minimal C# backend** (30 lines)
- **Complete betting system** (46 bet types)
- **Comprehensive statistics engine**
- **AngularJS frontend framework**
- **Metronic premium Bootstrap theme**

## Key Findings

### Architecture
- **Frontend-heavy design**: 100% of game logic runs client-side
- **Backend minimal**: Only serves static HTML and configuration
- **Technology stack**: ASP.NET MVC5, AngularJS, jQuery, Bootstrap 3

### Strategy Implementation
- **Modified Martingale**: Outside even-money bets only
- **Pattern detection**: Triggers on 2+ consecutive results
- **Auto-doubling**: Doubles bet after losses until win or limit
- **Loss limit**: 7 consecutive losses maximum
- **Bankroll**: $1,280 covers up to 6-loss streaks

### Game Components
- **GameEngineController.js**: Primary game engine (506 lines)
- **RouletteTable.js**: Betting system (495 lines)
- **RouletteWheel.js**: Wheel simulation (225 lines)
- **Index.cshtml**: Interactive UI (438 lines)

### Notable Features
- Real-time statistics and probability analysis
- Automated bet placement based on patterns
- Comprehensive loss streak tracking
- Observed vs theoretical probability comparison
- Event logging and spin history

## Critical Files & Paths

**Primary Game Logic**:
```
/Original.NET/Roulette Simulator/Scripts/controllers/GameEngineController.js
/Original.NET/Roulette Simulator/Scripts/controllers/RouletteTable.js
/Original.NET/Roulette Simulator/Scripts/controllers/RouletteWheel.js
```

**UI & Configuration**:
```
/Original.NET/Roulette Simulator/Views/Home/Index.cshtml
/Original.NET/Roulette Simulator/Web.config
/Original.NET/Roulette Simulator/App_Start/BundleConfig.cs
```

## Important Constants

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Starting Bankroll | $1,280 | Required for 6-7 loss streaks |
| Initial Bet | $10 | First bet amount |
| Pattern Threshold | 2 | Consecutive spins to trigger |
| Loss Limit | 7 | Stop after this many losses |
| Doubling Formula | 2x | Each loss doubles bet |
| Spin Interval | 3 seconds | Adjustable in UI |

## Code Quality Notes

**Strengths**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive statistics tracking
- Well-documented strategy (header comments)
- Professional UI with real-time updates

**Issues**:
- Debugger statement at line 101-102 (production issue)
- HTML built via string concatenation (maintenance nightmare)
- Global objects not fully namespaced
- Mixed jQuery and vanilla JavaScript

## How to Use These Documents

### For Understanding the Original Code
1. Start with **EXPLORATION_SUMMARY.md** for overview
2. Read **ORIGINAL_CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md** for details
3. Use **FILE_LOCATIONS_REFERENCE.md** to find specific code

### For Implementation
- Use strategy details from analysis for porting
- Reference betting system structure (46 bet types)
- Copy algorithm implementations verbatim
- Use data structure examples
- Reference UI patterns

### For Testing
- Use constants as test parameters
- Reference statistics methods for validation
- Check betting algorithm logic
- Verify payout calculations

## Statistics & Metrics

### Codebase Breakdown
- **JavaScript game logic**: 1,278 lines
- **HTML/RAZOR view**: 438 lines
- **C# backend**: 30 lines (minimal)
- **Configuration**: Multiple XML/C# files
- **External libraries**: jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS, Metronic

### Key Numbers
- **46 total bet types** (37 inside, 10 outside)
- **38 wheel positions** (0-36, 00)
- **7 tracked categories** (Red, Black, Green, Odd, Even, Low, High)
- **6 consecutive data structures** (trailing counters)

## References

### Game Theory
- Modified Martingale strategy with pattern detection
- Outside even-money bets (50/50 probability)
